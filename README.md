# Arduino-Light-Sensor
This project uses a photoresistor (LDR) to detect ambient light levels. When the light intensity falls below a certain threshold, the circuit activates a passive buzzer and an LED as visual and audible indicators. It demonstrates basic sensor input processing and output control using simple electronic components.
